# Twinner

Twinner is a deobfuscation and unpacking framework.
It inspects executable binaries, instruments them using the PIN Intel framework for binary instrumentation, analyzes executed assembly instructions through a concolic execution, models the behavior of the program as a set of symbolic expressions and constraints, and recodes it as twincode, a compilable C program with simplified logic.
The framework allows automatic deobfuscation of the virtualization obfuscated binaries on 64bit Linux and 32bit Windows.
The latest version is 0.24.0 and is a work in progress, so if you are not familiar with the context, you should wait for the v1.0.0 release. Otherwise, have happy hacking :) There is no regular release schedule and every version is released when it is ready.

## Installation

Use make files.

## Usage
