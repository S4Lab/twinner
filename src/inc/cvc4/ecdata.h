/**
 * ECData is a equivalence class object that is context dependent.
 * It is developed in order to support the congruence closure algorithm
 * in TheoryUF, and is not intended to be used outside of that package.
 *
 * ECData maintains:
 * - find pointer for the equivalence class (disjoint set forest)
 * - the node that represents the equivalence class.
 * - maintains a predecessorlist/watchlist
 *
 * ECData does not have support for the canonical find and union operators
 * for disjoint set forests.  Instead it only provides access to the find
 * pointer. The implementation of find is ccFind in TheoryUF.
 * union is broken into 2 phases:
 *  1) setting the find point with setFind
 *  2) taking over the watch list of the other node.
 * This is a technical requirement for the implementation of TheoryUF.
 * (See ccUnion in TheoryUF for more information.)
 *
 * The intended paradigm for iterating over the watch list of ec is:
 *      for(Link* i = ec->getFirst(); i != NULL; i = i->next );
 *
 * See also ECAttr() in theory_uf.h, and theory_uf.cpp where the codde that uses
 * ECData lives.

   * Tricky part: This needs to be a TNode, not a Node.
   * Suppose that rep were a hard link.
   * When a node n maps to an ECData via the ECAttr() there will be a hard
   * link back to n in the ECData. The attribute does not do garbage collection
