 *
 *   System.out.println("something"+somethingElse+"another thing");
 *
 * What to do to make this C++?!  Alas, you cannot
 * "#define System.out.println", because it has dots in it.
 * So we do the following.  Sigh.
 *
 * This is all C++, and the generated lexer/parser is C++, but that's
 * ok here, we use the C++ compiler anyway!  Plus, this is only code
