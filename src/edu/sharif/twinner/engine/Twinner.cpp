/**
 * Generates twin code and twin binary.
 * Steps:
 * 1. Without any special initialization (just giving as much arguments as possible,
 * to the program; indeed we do not need to reach even near max limits, just we must be
 * sure to use a lot of bytes to find places whom are used by user input to ignore
 * initializing them while generating the twin code), run program and obtain first trace,
 * 2. With completely different arguments, run program in change-detection mode for the
 * second trace,
 * 3. Find all symbols who change their initial values and mark them as user inputs (do
 * not store 2nd trace as it has no info else of position of user inputs),
 * 4. While generating twin code, initialize all symbols who were visited in first trace
 * segment, else of user inputs (user inputs and next trace segments' symbols remain
 * uninitialized to obtain and keep their values from user and syscalls),
 * 5. Since now (3rd execution and so on) use DFS or another search strategy to obtain a
 * set of new values for symbols to follow a new execution path and run program in
 * initialized mode (which despite change-detection mode, enforces symbols values)
 * with those symbols' values (initializing user inputs is not required when generating
 * twin code, but they should be initialized while running program as different execution
 * traces may be obtained with different user inputs),
 * 6. By each run, some new (surely non-user-input) symbols may be added to first
 * segment. If there was a symbol (at an address) in 2nd or later segments while there was
 * no symbols at that address in 1st segment, it should be added to first segment symbols
 * too (to have it initialized in the final twin code by its pre-syscall value),
 * 7. To obtain step-6's values, run program again (just one time for all symbols who are
 * tracked) at the end in initial-state-detection mode and look for values of those
 * symbols before first syscall. It's possible that a later trace, removes a symbol from
 * the set of non-initialized-in-1st-segment symbols. So search for those symbols just at
 * the end and then do that last/final run to look for their pre-1st-syscall values.
